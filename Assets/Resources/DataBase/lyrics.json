"Lyrics1":"I feel like I'm losing hope\nIn my body and my soul\nAnd the sky, it looks so ominous\nAnd as time comes to a halt\nSilence starts to overflow\nMy cries are inconspicuous\nTell me God, are you punishing me?\nIs this the price I'm paying for my past mistakes?\nThis is my redemption song\nI need you more than ever right now\nCan you hear me now?\nCause we're going to shout it loud\nEven if our word seem meaningless\nIt's like I'm carrying the weight of the world\nI wish that someway, somehow\nThat I can save every one of us\nBut the truth is that I'm only one girl\nMaybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to life\nCome to life...\n"
